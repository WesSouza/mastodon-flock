  A problem has been detected and this tab has been shut down because of Elon
  Musk's greed and lack of basic understanding of how the Internet works.<br />
  <br />
  ERR_ELON_KILLED_ALL_THE_BIRDS<br />
  <br />
  Twitter (or ùïè) removed all functionality from the free API that Mastodon Flock
  relied on for working. Unfortunately, the basic version is quite expensive to keep
  this a free service, so it was shut down.<br />
  <br />
  In the time the Mastodon Flock was alive, it helped 12,494 people find 109,311
  accounts on the Fediverse.<br />
  <br />
  Thanks everyone. It was nice while it lasted.<br />

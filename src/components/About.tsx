        Mastodon Flock is a web application that looks for Twitter users on
        ActivityPub-enabled platforms (the &ldquo;Fediverse&rdquo;), such as
        Mastodon.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        It works by connecting to your Twitter account, reading your contacts
        profile information, and checking if they have mentioned any external
        accounts with a URL or email.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Matching accounts are then listed so you can connect with them. If you
        use Mastodon, you are able to automatically follow, unfollow or export
        the results in a CSV format.

        On the <Anchor href={config.urls.home}>Setup Wizard</Anchor>, click
        Next. You will be presented with two choices:
      </Paragraph>
      <UnorderedList>
        <ListItem>
          &ldquo;Typical&rdquo; uses your Mastodon instance to find accounts.
          Once finished, it will allow you to review, follow or unfollow the
          discovered accounts.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; can be used to search every account on their
          own instance. This can be used if you are not on Mastodon, but another
          ActivityPub-compatible network. Note: this process is slower, and you
          won&rsquo;t be able to follow or unfollow accounts using this
          software.
        </ListItem>
      </UnorderedList>
      <Paragraph>
        Once you proceed, you will be asked to authenticate our software on
        Twitter, which allows us to read the necessary information from your
        follows.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Then, if you chose the &ldquo;Typical&rdquo; method, you will be
        prompted about your Mastodon instance, and asked to authenticate our
        software on it. That allows us to perform our search, as well as to let
        you follow and unfollow accounts.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        After the Setup concludes, you are taken to the Mastodon Flock results
        window, which displays every account that we could find.

      <Paragraph>
        Mastodon Flock relies on your Twitter follows information to discover
        their Fediverse account. The Setup process will look for potential
        emails or URLs on their name, bio, location, website and pinned tweet.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Afterwards, a search process navigates through each potential account,
        and if it finds a match, stores it locally. Once the process finishes,
        you are presented with the results, where you can perform actions.
